/* This program serves as both an example of using the Watchdog Timer
   peripheral on the Dreamcast's SH4 CPU as well as a test to validate
   the behavior of its driver in KOS.

   NOTE:
   At the time this is being written, there are no Dreamcast emulators
   out there which are bothering to emulate the SH4 WDT, since apparently
   no commercial games actually used it. Special care has been taken to
   fail the tests gracefully when there is no functioning WDT.
